In media and infotainment, "Drive Time" refers to the specific periods during weekday rush hours (typically 6-10 a.m. and 3-7 p.m.) when the largest number of commuters are listening to their car radios or in-car entertainment systems.
This term originated in traditional radio broadcasting, where these periods were identified as having the peak audience. The large, captive audience makes "drive time" the most valuable and expensive for advertisers.

Drivers select the "Track Drive Time" feature in their media and infotainment systems primarily for safety, efficiency, personal monitoring, and financial benefits such as insurance discounts or tax deductions.
Key reasons drivers use this feature include:
1. Safety Monitoring: The system tracks behaviors like speeding, harsh braking, and rapid acceleration. This data helps drivers (or parents/fleet managers in the case of teen or commercial drivers) identify and correct unsafe driving habits, thereby reducing the risk of accidents.
2. Efficiency and Cost Savings: Tracking drive time and associated data (idle time, mileage, routes) allows drivers to optimize their routes, minimize unnecessary mileage, and reduce fuel consumption. For businesses, this translates into significant operational cost savings.
3. Insurance Discounts: Many insurance companies offer "usage-based insurance" programs (like Progressive Snapshot or State Farm's Drive Safe & Save) that provide discounts to drivers who demonstrate safe driving habits and log fewer miles, which is tracked via the car's telematics system.
4. Compliance and Reporting: For commercial drivers (e.g., in logistics or delivery services), Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) automatically record driving hours to ensure compliance with federal regulations regarding hours of service (HOS), replacing manual paperwork.
5. Personal/Family Monitoring: Concerned individuals, such as parents of teenage drivers, use the feature to monitor their loved ones' locations and driving habits to ensure their safety and peace of mind.
6. Maintenance Scheduling: By monitoring actual vehicle usage and engine hours, the system can provide timely alerts for preventative maintenance tasks, such as oil changes or tire rotations, which extends the vehicle's lifespan and prevents costly breakdowns.
7. Tax Deductions/Accurate Records: For gig workers or self-employed individuals, accurate mileage and drive time tracking is essential for tax purposes and ensuring correct business expense deductions.
